        <p>JCrawl is a purely Java based top down adventure game. 
        The player controls a single character with variety of skills to explore myriad of rooms filled with dangers, loot and puzzles. 
        The players will be able to move freely in all directions, but shoot at the direction they are looking at only initially. 
        There will be many kind of items which will further enhance player's capabilities (Temporary power ups/ Permanent upgrades). 
        Some enemies will be stationary, some enemies will have hard coded behavior, some enemies will have independent basic AI. 
        There will be two types of objects: Independent/Dependent; 
        Independent objects (eg. Fire traps, Automatic doors) will perform their intended behavior regardless of whether the player input is present or not.
        Dependent objects (eg. Light switch, Doors) will perform their intended behavior IF it receives a player input.</p>
